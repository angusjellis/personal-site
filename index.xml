      <description>Summary Our legacy SCM system had been in use since ~2015. Five years&#39; worth of technical debt had built up (in terms of usrs, permissions, dependencies, naming conventions, etc).
I was given the task of planning and implementing our migration to GitHub.
Our old system was an absolutely critical system that supported the entirety of KPMG&amp;rsquo;s Engineering function, with around 600 users, and Â£millions of revenue dependent upon it.
There were around 3200 repos on the legacy system.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a DevOps Engineer based in Manchester.
My primary responsibilties involve building and maintaining my company&amp;rsquo;s Developer Productivity suite, using a mixture of vendor products and custom-built internal tools.
Outside of work, I&amp;rsquo;m a fitness enthusiast, a cryptocurrency evangelist/investor, a gamer, and I love getting to gigs (primarily heavy metal).
I&amp;rsquo;ve built this site as a static site, compiled using hugo, with the hugo tanka theme.
The site is deployed using a GitHub Actions Pipeline.</description>

      <description>Within my current role, I build internal tooling using Python, with the tooling hosted on AWS.
Some of the tooling is developed as a Flask App, while other aspects are deployed as Serverless functions.
I write CI/CD Pipelines in GitHub Acitons &amp;amp; Jenkins (preferably on Actions), with all source code being held on GitHub.
I work with the following AWS technologies: ECS, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, &amp;amp; VPC.</description>
