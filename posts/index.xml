      <description>Summary Our legacy SCM system had been in use since ~2015. Five years&#39; worth of technical debt had built up (in terms of usrs, permissions, dependencies, naming conventions, etc).
I was given the task of planning and implementing our migration to GitHub.
Our old system was an absolutely critical system that supported the entirety of KPMG&amp;rsquo;s Engineering function, with around 600 users, and Â£millions of revenue dependent upon it.
There were around 3200 repos on the legacy system.</description>
