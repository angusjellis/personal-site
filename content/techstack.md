Within my current role, I build internal tooling using Python, with the tooling hosted on AWS.

Some of the tooling is developed as a Flask App, while other aspects are deployed as Serverless functions.

I write CI/CD Pipelines in GitHub Acitons & Jenkins (preferably on Actions), with all source code being held on GitHub.

I work with the following AWS technologies: ECS, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, & VPC.
