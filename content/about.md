I'm a Platform Engineer based in the United Kingdom.

I work on the Platform team at doxy.me. We maintain the core infrastructure of the doxy.me platform, along with building developer enablement tooling.

Outside of work, I'm a fitness enthusiast, a drummer, and a voracious reader.

I've built this site  as a static site, compiled using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the [hugo tanka theme](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-tanka).

The site is deployed using a [GitHub Actions Pipeline](https://github.com/angusjellis/personal-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml).
