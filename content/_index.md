Welcome to my promotion website!

During my presentation, I'll be going through the information in the 'short posts' section of the website.

If you want more information on the stuff I'm talking about, you'll probably find it in the 'lomg posts' section (there's far more writing there than I could ever hope to speak about in 10 minutes).

If you'd like to know how this website is built and deployed, see the 'about' section of the website. If you're more interested in the skills I think I'd bring to the table as a Senior DevOps Engineer, please have a look at the 'skills' section.
